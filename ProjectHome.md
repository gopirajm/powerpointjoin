Given a text file with a list of powerpoint charts, PowerPoint Join will combine them all into a single presentation.  This is helpful if you maintain a library of charts that you combine to make multiple presentations.

Some have asked to make it more automated -- specify a directory and then combine all presentations.  I suppose it may be necessary to explain why I wrote this program.  At work, I have several dozen individual presentations that get combined in different ways to make a handouts for classes that I teach.  Each class has some common material and some material specific for the class.  Rather than maintaining directories of duplicated material (something I have wanted to avoid from the beginning), I maintain a list of text files that define the material for a class.  I keep all the charts in a directory with the text files defining the class material.  I can update individual presentations that might be used in several different classes.  Whenever I want to gather the class material, I choose a text file and combine the charts.

So for me to make it such that it combines all charts in a directory would be contrary to the purpose of me creating the program to begin with.  However, recognizing that some people may have this need, I've made the program open source, so you are most welcome to implement these changes :)

I hope you find this small tool useful.  If you do, thank God through Jesus Christ who has given me the talent to do it.
